<h1>StarRez EZ Package Tracker</h1>
<p>This is a tampermonkey script (but you can also just paste it into your console) that adds a much simpler method of checking in packages to the University of Kentucky&#39;s StarRez system.</p>
<p>This tool is of almost no use to anyone outside of the University of Kentucky, but feel free to take a look.</p>
<h2>To install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> extension to your browser</li>
<li>Open the extensions&#39;s dashboard (click on its icon and then click dashboard)</li>
<li>Go to the utilites tab</li>
<li>Paste <a href="https://jthoward64.github.io/ez-starrez-package-tracking/ez-package-tracker.js">https://jthoward64.github.io/ez-starrez-package-tracking/ez-package-tracker.js</a> into &quot;Import from URL&quot;</li>
<li>When prompted press install</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>When enabled, EZ Package Tracker will inject code into the StarRez website. This will add a box to the Quick Information tab of the student&#39;s profile.</p>

<p>To use the tracker, select the relevant box (checking a package in or out) and either type the barcode in and press enter or scan the barcode.</p>
<p>Then simple fill in the pickup location, the sipping type, any notes you have (optional), and press submit.</p>

<p>In some cases, the EZ Package Tracker may auto-detect the shipping type, in which case it will be auto-selected. Please double check this as it is somewhat unreliable, if it is wrong, you can change it just like normal.</p>
