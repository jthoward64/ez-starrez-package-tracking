# StarRez EZ Package Tracker

This is a tampermonkey script (but you can also just paste it into your console) that adds a much simpler method of checking in packages to the University of Kentucky's StarRez system.

This tool is of almost no use to anyone outside of the University of Kentucky, but feel free to take a look.
